						<h3>Education</h3>
						<p>	As a graduate from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology, my educational career has provided me with experiences that help guide me throughout the professional world on a daily basis. While outside of the scope of my career goals my undergraduate education has provided me with key knowledge and transferrable skills related to the field of Data Analytics. As a psychology major I aqcuired knowldge about human decision making and communication which are essential components in the presentation part of the Data Analysis process. Ultimately it is the stakeholders who make the decisions, using my psychology background I can be the bridge that helps stakeholders better understand and utilize data findings in order to make important decisions.  </p>

								<h3>Expereince</h3>
								<p>In my most recent role a Sr. Data Analyst in Revenue Strategy with Royal Caribbean Group I began to work with data beyond finding actionable insights, I began to create frameworks for automation processes that would action those insights to drive incremental revenue, and help to achieve departmental and company revenue KPIs. This role also provided me with exposure to creating data pipelines and workflows to update changes made by automation into live PowerBI dashboards, allowing key stakeholders to audit chagnes and provide feedback for continuous improvement to our teams projects. </p>
								<p>As an Analyst and Sr. Analyst for Revenue Management I had the opportunity to dive deep into understanding of business practices and performance metrics. By building the knowledge and skills needed to analyze relevant data to meet business metrics I was able to create over 10 million in incremental revenue for the portfolio of ships that I managed in the caribbean.</p>
								<p>A key point in my professional experience that led me down the path to becoming a Data Analyst, the Public Allies Central Florida program has provided me with hands on professional experience that is the foundation to growing in my career and educational goals. As a participant in this program I was fortunate enough to be partnered with Embrace Families Solutions where I work in the Pathways to Home Division as the Data and Enrollment Coordinator. In this role is where I was introduced to working with large data sets tracking thousands of our clients records and producing montlhy and qaurterly program reports. To make these processes more effeicient and visually appealing I utilized advanced Excel, SQL, and Tableau skills that made our stakeholders more engaged and involved in tracking our monlthy performances.</p>
								<p>Prior to my stint at Embrace Families I worked for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission as the Activities Coordinator and an Education Specialist at the Everglades Youth Camp. These experiences allowed me to get more in touch with myself as a leader and an instructor, and challenged me to become a more organized person and quick decision maker. These are skills that I value to this day as being able to navigate a fast paced and constantly changing work environment is essential to my success up unto this point.</p>

								<h3>Career Goals</h3>
								<p>There are many goals that I wish to accomplish throughout my professioonal career however summed up into three major career goals I hope to... 
									<ol>
										<li>Provide value and growth to any organization in which I am involved in.</li>
										<li>Always continue to learn and adapt to new working enviroments.</li>
										<li>Help to pave the way for other like minded indivuduals throughout their journey in life.</li>
									</ol>
								I believe that through staying curious, continuing to do what I love, and showing kindess and respect to everyone around me on a daily basis that I will achieve these goals.</p>
